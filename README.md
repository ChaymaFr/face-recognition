# Face recognition on the Yale Faces dataset using tensorflow

## Introduction

The Yale faces dataset is a benchmark dataset for facial recognition problems. It contains 165 images of 11 different persons. The pictures were taken in different settings: with/without glasses, laughing/ sad, sleepy, surprised,...

In this project we want to build an algorithm capable of of matching one image to the correct person (face recognition). We take a multi-label classification approach to this problem, meaning that we associate to each image a label corresponding to the relevant person figuring on it.
